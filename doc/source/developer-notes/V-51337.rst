**Opt-in required**

The tasks in the security role can enable the Linux Security Module (LSM) that
is appropriate for the Linux distribution in use. For Ubuntu, the default LSM
is AppArmor.  Refer to Ubuntu's `AppArmor documentation`_ for more details on
how AppArmor works.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_linux_security_module: yes

Setting the variable to ``yes`` will run the tasks that enable AppArmor.

.. _AppArmor documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor
